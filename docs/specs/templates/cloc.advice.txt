Can the code be made more concise?
Look for repetitive patterns that could be extracted into helper functions.

If not, split large source files into sibling modules or submodules in a folder;
consider refactoring to be more unit testable.

Avoid picking and removing individual lines to satisfy the linter,
prefer properly refactoring out testable code blocks.
